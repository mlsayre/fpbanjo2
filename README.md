Code for banjo sample library (Kontakt Scripting Language). I recorded every note of a banjo using several different articulations then mapped all of the notes into the software sampler Kontakt, which has powerful note manipulation tools available via scripting. Via scripted controls, user is able to control:

- banjo slide articulation speed 

- automatic switching between hammer-on and pull-off articulations

- vibrato size and speed 

- palmed mute articulation and its tone 

- automatic chord mode 
  - 16 chord types 
  - strummed up or down
  - variable strum speed
